Since you are an incoming, the main function of this server will be for you to ask questions as they come up.
We are well aware that the university services take a while to respond to your inquiries, therefore posting them here can result in a quicker response.
However, we cannot guarantee that we will find the solution you are looking for, and of course we cannot guarantee that any solution we may present is 100% accurate.

Regardless, I hope to see you soon in BICS.
